# SpaceGame
The game I created during my highschool capstone.
# Details
Terrible coding practices; no thought to time or space complexity. Please don't judge it, I hadn't had any formal Java instruction yet. I wonder if I can clean it up now.

# Todo
[ ] Doesn't seem to agree with modern Java, the buttons are all blank and don't start the game.
[ ] Make a little tutorial level so people will know what to do if I show it to people.
[ ] Learn how to package java for distrobution. Is running in the browser still a thing?
